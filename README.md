## 📌 Overview
This project implements a paging mechanism to simulate how virtual addresses are translated into physical addresses, while demonstrating how an operating system manages a physical memory space that is smaller than the total virtual memory required by processes.

## 🌐 Resources
- Programming Language: C
- Tools: Vscode, GitHub Codespaces

## 🗂️ Features
- Structured Data Handling: Custom structs created to store and manage data from acessos and config files.

- Address Translation: Simulates the conversion of virtual addresses into physical addresses using a page table.

- Page Fault Algorithms: Implements algorithms to detect and resolve page faults during memory access.

- Page Fault Correction Function: Dedicated function to handle and correct page faults efficiently.

- Page Table Implementation: Builds and maintains a page table to manage memory mapping.

- Formatted Output: Displays results and memory mappings in a clean, readable format.

- Main Execution Flow: Centralized main function orchestrating the paging simulation and memory operations.
